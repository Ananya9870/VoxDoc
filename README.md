# 🎙️ VoxDoc — Talk to Your Documents using RAG

VoxDoc is a **voice-enabled AI document assistant** that lets users upload PDF files, ask natural language questions, and receive **accurate, document-grounded answers** in both **text and voice**.

Built using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, VoxDoc combines semantic search, large language models, and speech synthesis to transform static documents into interactive knowledge sources.

## ✨ Key Highlights

- 📄 Upload and analyze PDF documents  
- 🔍 Semantic search powered by vector embeddings  
- 🧠 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture  
- 💬 Multiple chat sessions with independent memory  
- 🎙️ Voice responses via text-to-speech  
- ⚡ High-speed inference using Groq (LLaMA 3)  
- 🗄️ Local vector storage using Qdrant

## 🧩 How VoxDoc Works

1. A PDF document is uploaded by the user  
2. The document is split into meaningful text chunks  
3. Each chunk is converted into a vector embedding  
4. Embeddings are stored in a Qdrant vector database  
5. User asks a question in natural language  
6. Relevant chunks are retrieved based on semantic similarity  
7. The LLM generates a context-aware response  
8. The response is displayed and spoken aloud
